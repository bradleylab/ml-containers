## Images

### segment-any-tree-h100

SegmentAnyTree individual tree segmentation rebuilt for H100 GPUs (sm_90).

- Base: PyTorch 2.2.2 + CUDA 12.1
- MinkowskiEngine from [CiSong10/cuda12-installation](https://github.com/CiSong10/MinkowskiEngine/tree/cuda12-installation) fork
- Includes all patches for CUDA 12 compatibility (thrust namespace, NVTX3, std::to_address)

Two variants share the same CUDA / PyTorch / dependency stack — they
differ only in the checkpoint's `run_config` values:

| Tag | Dockerfile | Use case |
|-----|------------|---------|
| `:v2` (also `:latest`, `:cuda12.1-torch2.2`) | `Dockerfile` | Checkpoint patched with UAV-tuned clustering (`block_merge_th=0.3, cluster_radius_search=0.5, cluster_type=1, bandwidth=0.6`). |
| `:v2-defaults` (also `:cuda12.1-torch2.2-defaults`) | `Dockerfile.defaults` | Checkpoint kept exactly as shipped by SmartForest-no/SegmentAnyTree (Wielgosz et al. 2024 defaults). Use for new sensor modalities (e.g. TLS) or for "out-of-the-box DL baseline" comparisons. |

Pull:
```
ghcr.io/bradleylab/segment-any-tree-h100:v2
ghcr.io/bradleylab/segment-any-tree-h100:v2-defaults
```

Built automatically via GitHub Actions on push to
`segment-any-tree-h100/` (both workflows).

### ams3d-crownseg

AMS3D (Adaptive Mean-Shift 3D) via `crownsegmentr` on top of
`rocker/geospatial`. Classical method for UAV crown segmentation.

Pull: `ghcr.io/bradleylab/ams3d-crownseg:v1`

### fsct

Forest Structural Complexity Tool (Krisanski et al. 2021) — TLS / MLS
tree segmentation. CPU-only (FSCT pins torch 1.9 + CUDA 11.1 which
don't run on H100; porting is not worth the effort for our use case).

Pull: `ghcr.io/bradleylab/fsct:v1`

Run on Compute2 `general-cpu` partition.
